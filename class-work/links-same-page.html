                Computer science is concerned with the study of hardware, software, and theoretical aspects of 
                high-speed computing devices and with the application of these devices to scientific, technological, 
                and business problems.

                A bachelor's degree gives students a basic understanding of computer science. After completing a 
                required set of fundamental courses, students arrange their subsequent work around one of several 
                upper division tracks within either computer science or an interdisciplinary area involving computer 
                applications. The degree prepares students for graduate work or for various industrial, governmental, 
                and business positions involving the use of computers.

                The B.S. more upper division credits in computer science and related areas allowing the student to pursue 
                more deeply a particular area of computer science and tailor the degree to a specific area of interest. For 
                students who are more likely to practice in an area that is highly specialized or technical, the B.S. may 
                provide a better background than our B.A. in Computer Science.
